# About the project :
I have data from airline passengers where passengers rate different different services like how was the seat condition, food condition etc,
in this project my task is to make a model that can predict how likely a passenger will recommend that flight to their friends or families.
# How to use this project :
## Backend :
1. clone the repository
2. download the data from the given link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H1h6rFKqlpiBXnoWdZTDzUHQ1K1zy2B5?usp=drive_link
3. first of all run eda.ipynb file so that you may get desired dataset
4. then run main.ipynb to make build the model
## Steps :
1. Make virtual environment
2. install flask using command : pip install flask
3. open git bash and run : flask run --reload
4. you will get a link paste that link on your browser and make prediction
